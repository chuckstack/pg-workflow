  content: I am working on an psql application. Most of the business logic will exist in functions. I want to create a standard by which the function return information. I am inclined to use an approach that is similar to rust's option.

  content: "When designing a standard for function return values in PostgreSQL, you can indeed take inspiration from Rust's `Option` type. In PostgreSQL, you can use composite types to achieve a similar effect.\n\nHere's an approach you can consider:\n\n1. Create a custom composite type that represents the result of a function. This type will have two fields:\n   - `status`: A boolean value indicating the success or failure of the function.\n   - `value`: The actual return value of the function, which can be of any data type.\n\n2. Define your functions to return the custom composite type.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this approach:\n\n```sql\n-- Create the custom composite type\nCREATE TYPE function_result AS (\n    status boolean,\n    value anyelement\n);\n\n-- Create a function that returns the custom type\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION example_function(param1 integer, param2 text)\nRETURNS function_result AS $$\nDECLARE\n    result function_result;\nBEGIN\n    -- Function logic goes here\n    -- Set the status and value fields of the result\n    IF /* condition for success */ THEN\n        result.status := true;\n        result.value := /* successful return value */;\n    ELSE\n        result.status := false;\n        result.value := /* error message or default value */;\n    END IF;\n    \n    RETURN result;\nEND;\n$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- We create a custom composite type called `function_result` using the `CREATE TYPE` statement. It has two fields: `status` (boolean) and `value` (anyelement, which allows any data type).\n- We define a function called `example_function` that takes two parameters (`param1` and `param2`) and returns the `function_result` type.\n- Inside the function, we declare a variable `result` of type `function_result`.\n- We implement the function logic and set the `status` and `value` fields of the `result` variable based on the outcome of the function.\n- Finally, we return the `result` variable.\n\nTo use the function, you can call it and access the `status` and `value` fields of the returned composite type:\n\n```sql\nSELECT (example_function(10, 'hello')).status AS success,\n       (example_function(10, 'hello')).value AS return_value;\n```\n\nThis approach provides a standardized way to return both the success status and the return value from your functions. The `status` field indicates whether the function executed successfully, while the `value` field holds the actual return value.\n\nYou can adapt this approach to suit your specific needs and naming conventions. It allows you to handle function results consistently across your application and provides a clear way to determine the success or failure of a function call."

    Yes, you can execute the query `SELECT * FROM example_function(10, 'hello');` to retrieve the result of the function. However, since the function returns a composite type, you need to adjust the query slightly to access the individual fields of the returned type.

    Here's an example of how you can execute the query and access the fields:

    ```sql
    SELECT (example_function(10, 'hello')).*;
    ```

    In this query, we wrap the function call `example_function(10, 'hello')` inside parentheses and use the `.*` notation to expand the composite type and retrieve all its fields.

    Alternatively, you can specify the individual fields you want to retrieve:

    ```sql
    SELECT (example_function(10, 'hello')).status AS success,
           (example_function(10, 'hello')).value AS return_value;
    ```

    This query selects the `status` field as `success` and the `value` field as `return_value` from the result of the function call.

    Here's an example of how the output might look:

    ```
     success | return_value
    ---------+--------------
     true    | some_value
    ```

    In this example, the `success` column indicates the status of the function execution (true or false), and the `return_value` column contains the actual value returned by the function.

    By using the `SELECT` statement with the `.*` notation or specifying individual fields, you can retrieve the result of the function and access its fields as needed.

    Remember to replace `example_function`, `10`, and `'hello'` with your actual function name and parameter values when executing the query.

    In your example:
    SELECT (example_function(10, 'hello')).status AS success,
           (example_function(10, 'hello')).value AS return_value;

    It seems as though you are executing the function twice, is this true?

    You're absolutely right! In the example I provided, the function `example_function(10, 'hello')` is indeed being executed twice. This is because the function is called separately for each field in the `SELECT` clause.

    To avoid executing the function multiple times, you can use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to store the result of the function and then access its fields. Here's an example using a subquery:

    ```sql
    SELECT result.status AS success,
           result.value AS return_value
    FROM (
        SELECT example_function(10, 'hello') AS result
    ) AS subquery;
    ```

    In this query:
    1. The subquery `(SELECT example_function(10, 'hello') AS result)` executes the function once and assigns the result to the alias `result`.
    2. The outer `SELECT` statement accesses the `status` and `value` fields of the `result` composite type returned by the subquery.

    Alternatively, you can use a CTE:

    ```sql
    WITH function_result AS (
        SELECT example_function(10, 'hello') AS result
    )
    SELECT result.status AS success,
           result.value AS return_value
    FROM function_result;
    ```

    In this example:
    1. The CTE `function_result` executes the function once and assigns the result to the alias `result`.
    2. The main `SELECT` statement accesses the `status` and `value` fields of the `result` composite type from the CTE.

    Both the subquery and CTE approaches ensure that the function is executed only once, and the result is then used to retrieve the individual fields.

    Thank you for pointing out this inefficiency in the previous example. Using a subquery or CTE is a better approach to avoid multiple function executions and improve query performance.
