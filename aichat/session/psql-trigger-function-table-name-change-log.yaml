    Certainly! Here's an example of a PostgreSQL function and trigger that records the table name from which it was called:

    ```sql
    -- Function to record table changes
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION record_table_changes()
    RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
        -- Insert a new row into the audit table
        INSERT INTO audit_table (table_name, operation, timestamp)
        VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, NOW());

        -- Return the new row if it's an INSERT operation
        IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
            RETURN NEW;
        -- Return the old row if it's a DELETE operation
        ELSIF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
            RETURN OLD;
        -- Return NULL for UPDATE operation
        ELSE
            RETURN NULL;
        END IF;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

    -- Create the audit table
    CREATE TABLE audit_table (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        table_name VARCHAR(100),
        operation VARCHAR(10),
        timestamp TIMESTAMP
    );

    -- Create a trigger for a specific table
    CREATE TRIGGER example_table_trigger
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON example_table
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION record_table_changes();
    ```

    Explanation:
    1. The `record_table_changes()` function is defined using PL/pgSQL language. It takes no arguments and returns a trigger.

    2. Inside the function, an `INSERT` statement is used to insert a new row into the `audit_table`. The values inserted are:
       - `TG_TABLE_NAME`: A special variable that holds the name of the table that triggered the function.
       - `TG_OP`: A special variable that indicates the operation that triggered the function (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`).
       - `NOW()`: The current timestamp.

    3. The function then uses an `IF` statement to determine the operation type and return the appropriate value:
       - For an `INSERT` operation, it returns the `NEW` row.
       - For a `DELETE` operation, it returns the `OLD` row.
       - For an `UPDATE` operation, it returns `NULL`.

    4. The `audit_table` is created with columns to store the table name, operation, and timestamp.

    5. Finally, a trigger named `example_table_trigger` is created for a specific table (`example_table` in this case). The trigger is defined to execute the `record_table_changes()` function after an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation on the table.

    With this setup, whenever an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation is performed on the `example_table`, the `record_table_changes()` function will be called, and it will record the table name, operation, and timestamp in the `audit_table`.

    You can create similar triggers for other tables by replacing `example_table` with the desired table name in the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement.
