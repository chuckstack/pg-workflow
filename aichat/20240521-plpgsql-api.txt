I want you to help me design and code a postgresql application to support creating, managing and executing workflows in postgresql.
There will be two ways by which users will interact with the application: 1. using sql natively and 2. using a postgrest REST api build around the native sql.
Please note that our plan to use postgrest (rest api) is an important design consideration.
There will exist two schemas: 1. private - holding the internal representation of the workflow and 2. public - allowing users of sql and postgrest api to interact with private data.

Your goal is to design a collection of postgresql functions, triggers and any other postgresql developer tools to help users create and manage workflows.
It is acceptable for users to create records in many of the tables using standard CRUD techniques; however, some tables are better interacted with using functions.
Example tables where CRUD is acceptable: chuboe_user, chuboe_group, chuboe_state
Examples where creating and modifying records might be better served: populating link tables, managing state, managing next actions

Your explanation of each code snippit is greatly appreciated.
Your explanation of how each step fits in the bigger picture is appreciated.

I have included both the existing ddl and configuration records sql for your reference. All I am looking for are the additional postgresql artifacts that help users interact with the tables in a way that is consistent with REST concepts.
