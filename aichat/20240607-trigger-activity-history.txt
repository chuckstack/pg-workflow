I would like your help creating a psql trigger that automates the creation of a record in the stack_wf_request_activity_history table based on an update to the stack_wf_request table stack_wf_state_uu or stack_wf_transition_uu columns. Here are some important details:
- I have included the database domain for your reference in file: migration-10-ddl.sql
- I have included the functions that help automate and summarize the domain in file: migration-20-func.sql
- I have included a function that automates the creation of a stack_wf_process for a typical approval process in file: migration-30-template-approval-traditional.sql
- I have included a function that creates an example stack_wf_request in file: example-employee-leave-approval.sh
