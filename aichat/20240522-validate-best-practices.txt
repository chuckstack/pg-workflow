I want you to objectively evaluate table structure of migration-ddl.sql against your knowledge of workflow management and workflow best practices. My question is: does this design resemble best practices? Here are a couple of other questions to consider:
Is the data model functionally complete?
What concepts are missing?
Does it use the correct terminology?
