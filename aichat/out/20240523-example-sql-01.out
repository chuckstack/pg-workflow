Here's an example of how to create the SQL statement to insert a chuboe_request record:

1. Insert a new request:

INSERT INTO chuboe_request (chuboe_process_uu, title, date_requested, chuboe_user_uu, user_name, chuboe_current_state_uu)
VALUES (
  (SELECT chuboe_process_uu FROM chuboe_process WHERE name = 'Employee Leave Request'),
  'John Doe Leave Request',
  NOW(),
  (SELECT chuboe_user_uu FROM chuboe_user WHERE email = 'john.doe@example.com'),
  (SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) FROM chuboe_user WHERE email = 'john.doe@example.com'),
  (SELECT chuboe_state_uu FROM chuboe_state WHERE name = 'New Request' AND chuboe_process_uu = (SELECT chuboe_process_uu FROM chuboe_process WHERE name = 'Employee Leave Request'))
);

Discussion: This SQL statement inserts a new request into the chuboe_request table. Here's what each part of the statement does:

- We select the chuboe_process_uu for the 'Employee Leave Request' process using a subquery.
- We provide a title for the request, in this case, 'John Doe Leave Request'.
- We use the NOW() function to set the date_requested to the current timestamp.
- We select the chuboe_user_uu for the user with the email 'john.doe@example.com' using a subquery.
- We concatenate the first_name and last_name of the user to set the user_name value.
- We select the chuboe_state_uu for the 'New Request' state within the 'Employee Leave Request' process using a subquery. This sets the initial state of the request.

By executing this SQL statement, a new request will be inserted into the chuboe_request table with the specified process, title, requester, and initial state. This represents an employee submitting a new leave request.

2. Retrieve the inserted request:

SELECT *
FROM chuboe_request
WHERE title = 'John Doe Leave Request';

Discussion: After inserting the request, you can retrieve it from the chuboe_request table to verify that it was successfully inserted. This SQL statement selects all columns from the chuboe_request table where the title matches 'John Doe Leave Request'.

By executing this SELECT statement, you can view the details of the inserted request, including its chuboe_request_uu, chuboe_process_uu, title, date_requested, chuboe_user_uu, user_name, and chuboe_current_state_uu.

These SQL statements demonstrate how to insert a new request into the chuboe_request table and retrieve it for verification. You can use similar statements to insert requests for different employees and scenarios within the 'Employee Leave Request' process.
