The task at hand is to automate the process of converting and exposing a subset of private SQL functions from a private schema to the public with a simplified facade. This will be achieved by creating a script (`copy-private-functions.sh`) that reads an input SQL file containing function definitions, filters and processes relevant functions, and produces a new output SQL file with public-facing function definitions. 

Let's outline a solution based on Bash scripting (as per the script `copy-private-functions.sh`), but also fill in the pseudo-code with actual script lines.

### Updated `copy-private-functions.sh` Script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Exit when any command fails
set -e

################################################
# Script to copy private SQL functions to a public schema with a simplified API.
# It filters out any function with 'trigger_func' in the name, any SQL triggers,
# and transforms functions to approach only through a public facade.
################################################

# Check if the input file is provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <input_file_path>"
  exit 1
fi

# Define paths
script_path=$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")
input_file_path=$(readlink -f "$1")
output_file="$script_path/$(basename "${input_file_path%.*}")_public_api.sql"

# Prepare output file
echo "-- Generated public API functions" >"$output_file"
echo "-- This file contains wrapped functions from a private schema for public use." >>"$output"
echo "" >>"$output_file"

# Read through each line of the input SQL file
while IFS= read -r line
do
  if echo "$line" | grep -qE "^\s*CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION" && ! echo "$line" | grep -qi "trigger_func"; then
    # Extract function name and parameters
    func_name=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP "(?<=FUNCTION ).*(?=\()")
    old_prefix=$(echo "$func_name" | grep -o "^[^_]*_[^_]*")
    new_prefix="api${old_prefix#*stack}"
    public_func_name=$(echo "$func_name" | sed "s/$old_prefix/$new_prefix/")
    
    # Format parameters and types
    params=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP "\((.*)\)$")
    
    # Prepare public function definition
    echo "CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION $public_func_name$params" >>"$output_file"
    echo "RETURNS text AS \$BODY\$" >>"$output_file"
    echo "BEGIN" >>"$output_file"
    echo "  RETURN $func_name$param;" >>"$output_file"
    echo "END;" >>"$output_file"
    echo "\$BODY\$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;" >>"$output_file"
    echo "" >>"$output_file"  # Add empty line after each function definition

    # Function comment
    echo "COMMENT ON FUNCTION $public_func_name$params IS '`sed -n "/COMMENT ON FUNCTION $func_name/,/;$/p" $input_file_path | sed "1d;\$d"`';" >>"$output_file"
    echo "" >>"$output_file"
  fi
done < "$input_file_path"

echo "Completed processing and creating public API SQL functions."
```

### Breakdown and Additional Information:

1. **Script Setup**: The script includes error handling and parameter checking to ensure it's called with the necessary arguments.
2. **File and Path Handling:** Paths to the input file and output file are determined. File handling operations are done relative to the scriptâ€™s own path.
3. **Reading and Processing SQL**: The file is read line by line, filtering out lines related to triggers or functions not suitable for public API based on given conditions.
4. **Function Name Handling**: The prefix of the function names is altered according to the public API needs.
5. **Function Wrapping**: Functions are wrapped so that they merely call their private counterparts. This is in accordance with the SQL interface encapsulation principle.
6. **Efficiency Considerations**: The script uses `grep` and `sed` for line parsing and transformation. These tools are powerful but can be tricky in terms of correct pattern matching and text manipulation across multiple lines.

This script is conceptual and might require further adjustments based on more specific implementations or the exact SQL syntax. Additional functionalities such as better error messages, more complex function parameter transformations, or managing dependencies could be considered for a more robust script.
