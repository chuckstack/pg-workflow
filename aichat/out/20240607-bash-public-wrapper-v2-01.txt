Here's the updated version of the script with the requested improvements:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

################################################
# This script converts a file with SQL CREATE TABLE statements into a file with CREATE VIEW statements.
# It also preserves the table comments and adds an empty line after each comment.
#
# The script does the following:
#
# 1. It checks if an input file is provided as a command-line argument. If not, it displays the usage message and exits.
#
# 2. It sets the input file name based on the provided argument and generates the output file name by appending "_views.sql" to the input file name (without the extension).
#
# 3. It reads the input file line by line using a `while` loop.
#
# 4. For each line, it checks if the line starts with "CREATE TABLE":
#    - If it does, it extracts the table name using `awk` and stores it in a variable.
#    - It creates the view statement using the extracted table name, referring to the original table name in the FROM clause.
#    - It writes the view statement to the output file.
#
# 5. If the line starts with "COMMENT ON TABLE":
#    - It extracts the table name from the comment using `awk` and removes the prefix using `sed`.
#    - It writes the comment to the output file.
#    - It adds an empty line after the comment in the output file.
#
# 6. Finally, it displays a success message indicating that the views have been created in the output file.
################################################

# Check if the input file is provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <input_file>"
  exit 1
fi

input_file=$1
output_file="${input_file%.*}_views.sql"

# Process each line of the input file
while IFS= read -r line; do
  # Check if the line starts with "CREATE TABLE"
  if [[ $line =~ ^CREATE\ TABLE ]]; then
    # Extract the table name
    table_name=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $3}')
    view_name=$(echo "$table_name" | sed 's/stack_\(wf_\)\?//')

    # Create the view statement
    view_statement="CREATE VIEW $view_name AS SELECT * FROM $table_name;"

    # Write the view statement to the output file
    echo "$view_statement" >> "$output_file"
  elif [[ $line =~ ^COMMENT\ ON\ TABLE ]]; then
    # Extract the table name from the comment and remove the prefix
    table_name=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/stack_\(wf_\)\?//')

    # Write the comment to the output file
    echo "$line" | sed "s/stack_\(wf_\)\?$table_name/$table_name/" >> "$output_file"

    # Add an empty line after the comment
    echo "" >> "$output_file"
  fi
done < "$input_file"

echo "Views created successfully in $output_file"
```

The main changes made to the script are:

1. The comments have been updated to reflect the changes made.
2. When creating the view statement, the original table name is stored in the `table_name` variable, and the view name is derived from it by removing the prefix using `sed`. The view statement now refers to the original table name in the FROM clause.
3. When writing the comment to the output file, an empty line is added after each comment using `echo "" >> "$output_file"`.

These improvements should produce the desired output format:

```sql
CREATE VIEW process_type AS SELECT * FROM stack_wf_process_type;
COMMENT ON TABLE process_type IS 'some comment';

CREATE VIEW target_type AS SELECT * FROM stack_wf_target_type;
COMMENT ON TABLE target_type IS 'some comment';
```
