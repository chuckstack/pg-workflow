Here's an example PostgreSQL function to create a `chuboe_request` and its associated details, along with the necessary triggers:

```sql
-- Function to create a chuboe_request
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_chuboe_request(
    p_process_name VARCHAR,
    p_title VARCHAR,
    p_requester_email VARCHAR,
    p_initial_state_name VARCHAR
)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    v_process_uu UUID;
    v_requester_uu UUID;
    v_initial_state_uu UUID;
    v_request_uu UUID;
BEGIN
    -- Get the process UUID based on the process name
    SELECT chuboe_process_uu INTO v_process_uu
    FROM chuboe_process
    WHERE name = p_process_name;

    -- Get the requester UUID based on the requester email
    SELECT chuboe_user_uu INTO v_requester_uu
    FROM chuboe_user
    WHERE email = p_requester_email;

    -- Get the initial state UUID based on the state name and process UUID
    SELECT chuboe_state_uu INTO v_initial_state_uu
    FROM chuboe_state
    WHERE name = p_initial_state_name AND chuboe_process_uu = v_process_uu;

    -- Insert a new request
    INSERT INTO chuboe_request (chuboe_process_uu, title, date_requested, chuboe_user_uu, user_name, chuboe_current_state_uu)
    VALUES (v_process_uu, p_title, NOW(), v_requester_uu, (SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) FROM chuboe_user WHERE chuboe_user_uu = v_requester_uu), v_initial_state_uu)
    RETURNING chuboe_request_uu INTO v_request_uu;

    -- Add the requester as a stakeholder
    INSERT INTO chuboe_request_stakeholder_lnk (chuboe_request_uu, chuboe_user_uu)
    VALUES (v_request_uu, v_requester_uu);

    -- Add an initial note to the request
    INSERT INTO chuboe_request_note (chuboe_request_uu, chuboe_user_uu, note)
    VALUES (v_request_uu, v_requester_uu, 'Request created');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This function takes the process name, request title, requester email, and initial state name as parameters. It performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves the process UUID based on the provided process name.
2. Retrieves the requester UUID based on the provided requester email.
3. Retrieves the initial state UUID based on the provided state name and process UUID.
4. Inserts a new request into the `chuboe_request` table with the retrieved values.
5. Adds the requester as a stakeholder by inserting a record into the `chuboe_request_stakeholder_lnk` table.
6. Adds an initial note to the request by inserting a record into the `chuboe_request_note` table.

Now, let's create a trigger to automatically insert a record into the `chuboe_request_action_log` table when a new request is created:

```sql
-- Trigger function to log request creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_request_creation()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Insert a record into the chuboe_request_action_log table
    INSERT INTO chuboe_request_action_log (chuboe_request_uu, chuboe_action_uu, chuboe_transition_uu, is_active, is_processed)
    VALUES (NEW.chuboe_request_uu, NULL, NULL, true, false);

    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Trigger to log request creation
CREATE TRIGGER tr_log_request_creation
AFTER INSERT ON chuboe_request
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_request_creation();
```

This trigger function logs the creation of a new request by inserting a record into the `chuboe_request_action_log` table. The trigger is defined to fire after each row insertion on the `chuboe_request` table.

With these functions and triggers in place, you can create a new request by calling the `create_chuboe_request` function:

```sql
SELECT create_chuboe_request(
    'Employee Leave Request',
    'John Doe Leave Request',
    'john.doe@example.com',
    'New Request'
);
```

This will create a new request for the 'Employee Leave Request' process, with the title 'John Doe Leave Request', requested by the user with email 'john.doe@example.com', and set the initial state to 'New Request'. It will also add the requester as a stakeholder, insert an initial note, and log the request creation in the `chuboe_request_action_log` table.

You can further enhance the functions and triggers based on your specific requirements and add more functionality as needed.
