I want you help improving the script: copy-private-functions.sh

The issue is that the output of the script is missing the function parameters. I have included an example of what it is current producing: migration-20-func_api.sql

Will you kindly update the script to better capture the parameters?

Below are example of the desired output of the file.


example:1 of what is expected to be created:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION api_boolean_yes_no(p_boolean boolean)
RETURNS text AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN wf_private.stack_boolean_yes_no(p_boolean);
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER;
COMMENT ON FUNCTION api_boolean_yes_no(boolean) is 'Function for convenience to convert boolean into Yes/No text';
```

example:2 of what is expected to be created:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION api_boolean_open_close(p_boolean boolean)
RETURNS text AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN wf_private.stack_boolean_open_close(p_boolean);
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER;
COMMENT ON FUNCTION api_boolean_open_close(boolean) is 'Function for convenience to convert boolean into Open/Closed text';
```
