I would like your help creating an example employee leave approval request from the below framework.
Here are the details:

- You can assume the migration-03-template-approval-traditional.sql script has already been executed to create a process named
- You will use the stack_wf_request_create_from_process(...) function from the migration-02-func.sql file to create the request from the process.
