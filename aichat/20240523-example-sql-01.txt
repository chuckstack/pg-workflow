I want you to help me finish the employee leave example.
We will take this one step at a time.

To help make this as easy as possible, I will upload files for your reference.
1. an example of how to structure example response
2. process admin work instructions
3. the migration-ddl script that creates the workflow database
4. the example employee-leave.sql that we have created thus far

The next goal is to create the sql statement to insert a chuboe_request record.
I will test your response against my database, then I will ask agian for the next step.
