I want your help to creating a public facing sql schema. Here are the details:
- I have a private sql schema where I create tables, views and functions to help support a domain.
- I want to create a public sql schema that acts as a facade so that others can interact with the domain and so that I can control what changes the public sees.
- The private schema already exists. Here is a file with the functions defined: migration-20-func.sql
- I want you to help me write a bash script that automates creating the public schema facade (pass though) functions based on the existing private schema functions.
- Note the name prefix of the private function changes from 'stack_' or 'stack_wf_' to 'api_' for the public functions.
- Some functions have inner functions defined that are indented; therefore, you only need to pay attention to lines that are not indented.
- Note that we need to keep the comment on the function.
- We need an empty line between function definitions.
- We have already written a similar script for automating tables/views. This is simply for reference so that the styles can be consistent. See: copy-private-tables-to-view.sh
- The script should take the input file as a script parameter (like copy-private-tables-to-view.sh).
- The script should keep the output file name similar and add a suffix like: _api
- The script should save the output file in the same directory is the script that is executed (like copy-private-tables-to-view.sh)
- The script should have documentation at the top (like copy-private-tables-to-view.sh)

example 1:
``` sql
CREATE FUNCTION api_boolean_yes_no(p_boolean boolean)
RETURNS text AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN wf_private.stack_boolean_yes_no(p_boolean);
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER;
COMMENT ON FUNCTION api_boolean_yes_no(boolean) is 'Function for convenience to convert boolean into Yes/No text';
```

example 2:
```
CREATE FUNCTION api_boolean_open_close(p_boolean boolean)
RETURNS text AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN wf_private.stack_boolean_open_close(p_boolean);
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER;
COMMENT ON FUNCTION api_boolean_open_close(boolean) is 'Function for convenience to convert boolean into Open/Closed text';
```
