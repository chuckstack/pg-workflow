I would like your help writting a bash script to convert a file with sql create table statements into a file with create view statements. Here is an example:

CREATE TABLE stack_wf_process_type (
  stack_wf_process_type_uu UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  created TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  search_key VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  UNIQUE (search_key)
);
COMMENT ON TABLE stack_wf_process_type IS 'some commment here';

Here is an example of what I want to create:

create view process_type as
select * from process_type;
COMMENT ON TABLE process_type IS 'some commment here';

Notes:
- all tables will begin with either stack_ or stack_wf_. I want to remove this prefix when creating the view.
- I want to preserve the comment as well.
