I would like your help creating a nushell script that does the following:
- helps me interact with a rest service from the cli
- includes subcommand for every http rest verb (get, post, delete, etc...)
- documents the script well so that the autogenerated nushell help is useful
- each of the subcommands needs the following:
  - needs a mandatory table flag (--table or -t) of type string
  - needs an optional where flag (--where or -w) of type string
  - needs an optional columns flag (--columns or -c) of type string
- note that the rest api is provided by postgrest

- note that I am using nushell version 0.95

Here is an example nushell command to help act as a guide:

# An example greeting command that can greet the caller
def greet [
   name: string = "some default"  # name of the person
   --age (-a): int                # age of the person
   --twice                        # flag to print again
 ] {
   if $twice {
     [$name $name $age $age]
   } else {
     [$name $age]
   }
 }
