I want you to help me design and code a postgresql application to support creating, managing and executing workflows in postgresql.

I am including migration-ddl.sql for your reference so that you know the current application domain.

I want you to propose a new version of migration-config.sql that contains sql insert statements to meet the following criteria:
* We need initial chuboe_state_type records. Here are the recommended names and descriptions:
  * Start: Should only be one per process. This state is the state into which a new Request is placed when it is created.
  * Normal: A regular state with no special designation.
  * Complete: A state signifying that any Request in this state have completed normally.
  * Denied: A state signifying that any Request in this state has been denied (e.g. never got started and will not be worked on).
  * Cancelled: A state signifying that any Request in this state has been cancelled (e.g. work was started but never completed).
* It is ok to modify (add, remove, change) the list of chuboe_state_type records based on your knowledge of workflow. Please explain your logic if you make changes.

* We need initial chuboe_action_type records. Here are the recommended names and descriptions:
  * Approve: The actioner is suggesting that the request should move to the next state.
  * Deny: The actioner is suggesting that the request should move to the previous state.
  * Cancel: The actioner is suggesting that the request should move to the Cancelled state in the process.
  * Restart: The actioner suggesting that the request be moved back to the Start state in the process.
  * Resolve: The actioner is suggesting that the request be moved all the way to the Completed state.
* It is ok to modify (add, remove, change) the list of chuboe_action_type records based on your knowledge of workflow. Please explain your logic if you make changes.

* We need initial chuboe_activity_type records. Here are the recommended names and descriptions:
  * Add Note: Specifies that we should automatically add a note to a Request.
  * Send Email: Specifies that we should send an email to one or more recipients.
  * Add Stakeholders: Specifies that we should add one or more persons as Stakeholders on this request.
  * Remove Stakeholders: Specifies that we should remove one or more stakeholders from this request.
* It is ok to modify (add, remove, change) the list of chuboe_activity_type records based on your knowledge of workflow. Please explain your logic if you make changes.

* We need initial chuboe_target records. Here are the recommended names and descriptions:
  * Requester:
  * Stakeholders:
  * Group Members:
  * Process Admins:
* It is ok to modify (add, remove, change) the list of chuboe_target records based on your knowledge of workflow. Please explain your logic if you make changes.
