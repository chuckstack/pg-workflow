Here is a concern that I expressed:
----------
Upon reviewing the employee-leave.sql, I an not happy with the user experience of simply inserting a record into chuboe_request. One way to imporve the user experience is to create a psql function that takes a couple of arguments and create the chuboe_request record along with inserting any other link table records that are needed to execute the request lifecycle. It is not required to be psql function. The alternative is using triggers to insert the supporting records. Or, it can be a combination of both. The benefit of the psql function is that you can have multiple functions as options to initiate the chuboe_request. Please provide your feedback as to what you believe is best.

Here was your response:

Based on the provided context, I believe using a combination of PostgreSQL functions and triggers would be the best approach for creating and managing requests in the workflow management system. Here's my feedback and reasoning:

1. Using PostgreSQL Functions:
   - Creating a PostgreSQL function to handle the creation of a request and the insertion of associated records in the link tables can provide a clean and encapsulated way to manage the request lifecycle.
   - The function can take relevant arguments such as the process ID, requester ID, request title, and any other necessary data.
   - Inside the function, you can perform the necessary insertions into the `chuboe_request` table and any related link tables (e.g., `chuboe_request_stakeholder_lnk`, `chuboe_request_action_log`).
   - The function can handle the logic of setting the initial state of the request based on the process definition.
   - Multiple functions can be created to handle different scenarios or variations of request creation, providing flexibility and reusability.

2. Using Triggers:
   - Triggers can be used to automatically execute certain actions or insert records into supporting tables when a request is created or updated.
   - For example, you can create a trigger that fires after a new request is inserted into the `chuboe_request` table.
   - The trigger can automatically insert records into the `chuboe_request_action_log` table to log the initial action and transition.
   - Triggers can also be used to enforce certain business rules or validations during the request lifecycle.

3. Combining Functions and Triggers:
   - You can leverage the strengths of both functions and triggers to create a robust and automated request management system.
   - The PostgreSQL function can handle the core logic of creating a request and inserting records into the main tables.
   - Triggers can be used to automatically populate supporting tables or perform additional actions based on the request creation or state changes.
   - This combination allows for a clean separation of concerns and promotes code reusability and maintainability.

Here are a few reasons why I believe this approach is the best:

1. Encapsulation and Modularity:
   - Using functions to handle request creation provides a clear and encapsulated way to manage the process.
   - Functions can be designed to accept specific arguments and return relevant results, making the code more modular and reusable.
   - Different functions can be created for different request scenarios, allowing for flexibility and customization.

2. Automation and Consistency:
   - Triggers can automate certain actions and ensure data consistency across related tables.
   - By using triggers, you can enforce business rules and maintain data integrity without manual intervention.
   - Triggers can be used to log actions, update statuses, or perform any other necessary tasks based on the request lifecycle.

3. Separation of Concerns:
   - Combining functions and triggers allows for a clear separation of concerns.
   - Functions can handle the core request creation logic, while triggers can take care of the supporting actions and data management.
   - This separation makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand and modify.

4. Performance and Efficiency:
   - Using functions and triggers can improve performance by minimizing the number of individual SQL statements executed.
   - Functions can perform multiple insertions or updates within a single database transaction, reducing the overhead of multiple round trips to the database.
   - Triggers can automatically handle supporting actions, eliminating the need for additional queries or manual interventions.

In summary, using a combination of PostgreSQL functions and triggers provides a powerful and flexible approach to create and manage requests in the workflow management system. It allows for encapsulation, automation, separation of concerns, and improved performance, leading to a more robust and maintainable system.

I agree with your response. Will you please do the following:
----------
Please provide an example psql function to create the chuboe_request and associated details. Please create any triggers that you believe are also needed.
