I would like your improving the bash script named copy-private-tables-to-view.sh. It convert a file with sql create table statements into a file with create view statements. I would like your help to improve it in the following ways:
- I need an empty line after each comment.
- In the from clause, I need it to refor to the original table's name.

Here is what it currently produces:

```sql
CREATE VIEW process_type AS SELECT * FROM process_type;
COMMENT ON TABLE process_type IS 'some comment';
CREATE VIEW target_type AS SELECT * FROM target_type;
COMMENT ON TABLE target_type IS 'some comment';
```

Here is would I would like it to produce:

```sql
CREATE VIEW process_type AS SELECT * FROM stack_wf_process_type;
COMMENT ON TABLE process_type IS 'some comment';

CREATE VIEW target_type AS SELECT * FROM stack_wf_target_type;
COMMENT ON TABLE target_type IS 'some comment';
```

Please produce a new version for me with these improvements. Please update the comments as well if needed.
