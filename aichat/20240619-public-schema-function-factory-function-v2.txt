I have a psql function named create_public_functions(). This function does the following:
1. Creates the public schema if it doesn't exist.
2. Iterates over the private functions starting with 'stack' and not containing 'trigger_func' in the name.
3. Transforms the function name for the public function by replacing 'stack_' with 'api_' or 'stack_wf_' with 'api_wf_'.
4. Retrieves the comment of the private function.
5. Constructs the pass-through function definition in the public schema using the transformed function name and the argument types of the private function.
6. Executes the function definition to create the public function.
7. Sets the comment on the public function if the private function has a comment.

When executing, it gives the followng error:
ERROR:  42601: syntax error at or near "AS"
LINE 3:         RETURNS SETOF  AS
                               ^

If you can see the error, please recommend a fix. Otherwise, I believe we need to simply the function_definition variable by moving some logic out of the format statement and into its own variable.
