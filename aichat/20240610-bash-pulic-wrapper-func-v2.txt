I want you help improving the script: copy-private-functions.sh

It has an issue in that it was written assuming that a function was defined with the phrase: "CREATE FUNCTION"

In fact, the function is most likely defined as "CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION". You will notice that I modified the if statment to add a wildcard between CREATE and FUNCTION.

Will you kindly create a new version of the script to take these details into account?

Note that I included the file to be migrated: migration-20-func.sql


example:1 of what is expected to be created:
``` sql
CREATE FUNCTION api_boolean_yes_no(p_boolean boolean)
RETURNS text AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN wf_private.stack_boolean_yes_no(p_boolean);
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER;
COMMENT ON FUNCTION api_boolean_yes_no(boolean) is 'Function for convenience to convert boolean into Yes/No text';
```

example:2 of what is expected to be created:
```
CREATE FUNCTION api_boolean_open_close(p_boolean boolean)
RETURNS text AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
  RETURN wf_private.stack_boolean_open_close(p_boolean);
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER;
COMMENT ON FUNCTION api_boolean_open_close(boolean) is 'Function for convenience to convert boolean into Open/Closed text';
```
