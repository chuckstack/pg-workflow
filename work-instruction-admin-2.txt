Here is a simplified explanation of how the concepts in the migration-01-ddl.sql file fit together to enable the creation, management, and execution of workflows in PostgreSQL:

1. The chuboe_process table represents the starting point of workflow design and execution. It describes what is possible in a workflow scenario.

2. Process attributes are defined in various tables, such as chuboe_group (users involved), chuboe_state (possible states), chuboe_action (actions to change states), chuboe_resolution (resolutions), chuboe_target (recipients of actions), and chuboe_activity (activities resulting from state transitions).

3. The chuboe_request table represents an instance of a process. It maintains the current state and references the process it belongs to.

4. Request attributes are stored in tables like chuboe_request_note, chuboe_request_data, chuboe_request_file, and chuboe_request_stakeholder_lnk.

5. The chuboe_transition table defines the transitions between states in a process, showing how a request can move between states.

6. Link tables (e.g., chuboe_action_transition_lnk, chuboe_action_target_lnk, chuboe_activity_target_lnk) establish relationships between actions, transitions, targets, and activities.

7. The chuboe_request_activity_history table records every activity resulting from a transition, along with the target, user/group, and processing status.

Now, let's go through a step-by-step process of how a workflow admin can design and execute their first process:

1. Define the process:
   - Insert a record into the chuboe_process table with a unique search_key, name, and description.
   - Specify the chuboe_process_type_uu to indicate the type of process (e.g., traditional, ad-hoc, queue-based, or checklist).

2. Define process attributes:
   - Create groups (chuboe_group) and assign users to those groups (chuboe_group_member_lnk).
   - Define states (chuboe_state), resolutions (chuboe_resolution), actions (chuboe_action), targets (chuboe_target), and activities (chuboe_activity) for the process.

3. Define transitions:
   - Insert records into the chuboe_transition table to specify the possible transitions between states.
   - Optionally, include resolutions for each transition.

4. Link actions, targets, and activities:
   - Use chuboe_action_transition_lnk to link actions to transitions and specify resolutions.
   - Use chuboe_action_target_lnk to define who can perform each action.
   - Use chuboe_activity_target_lnk to specify who receives each activity.

5. Execute the workflow:
   - Insert a new record into the chuboe_request table, specifying the process, initial state, and resolution.
   - As the request progresses, update its state and resolution based on the actions performed and transitions followed.
   - Record each activity resulting from a transition in the chuboe_request_activity_history table.

6. Monitor and manage the workflow:
   - Query the chuboe_request table to view the current state and resolution of each request.
   - Query the chuboe_request_activity_history table to see pending activities for each request.
   - Update process attributes, transitions, and links as needed to optimize the workflow.

By following these steps, a workflow admin can design and execute their first process using the tables and relationships defined in the migration-01-ddl.sql file.
